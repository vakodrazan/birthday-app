# Birthday App

In this project, all I need is that showing a list of people sorted by the soonest birthday.
 - You have a file in the project called `person.json`. It contains a list of persons, which I want to add all those persons to our birthday list app.
 - I just import because the data lives in the local json.
 
 ### Deployment 
 Deploy it with netlify once you are done. If you already have an account that's great. But here are some tips if you don't have an account yet.
 - Click [here](https://app.netlify.com/signup). And follow the steps to get started.

 ## Structure: 
 I built it with ***vanilla javascript***, ***bootstrap*** and just a normal css.

 - You can delete item from the list. You can edit also you can add new one. Once you make change they will be saved there for you because it is saved in the local storage.
 - All the list is sorted by the soonest birthday date.
 -  Also, you can search for people by typing their name (Firstname or lastname) and month of birth. But you can reset that search.
