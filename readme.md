# Birthday App

In this project, all I need is that showing a list of people sorted by the soonest birthday.
 - I have a file in the project called `person.json`. Which contains lists of peole. That's what I need to use.
- Users can make changes to the design such as editing an item from the list.
- All the changes will be saved on the local storage.
- All the list is sorted by the soonest birthday date.
 -  Also, you can search for people by typing their name (Firstname or lastname) and month of birth. But you can reset that search.

## Technology
- I built it with ***Vanilla JavaScript***, ***HTML5***, and ***CSS***.

## Design
- You can find the design:
